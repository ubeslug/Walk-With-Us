~ start
While walking down the road you hear some rustling from some tall grass off the side of the road in front of you. You stop to ready yourself for whatever it could be. 
Then a brown furred creature hops out from the grass onto the road. It stops in the middle barring your path. The creature is about the size of a small dog but it strangel;y has a crown of sharp looking horns on its head that branch out into many directions. The horns remind you of another animal you can’t seem to remember right now. This creature seems to be making eye contact with you putting you into a stalemate with the creature. Who will act first? What will you do?
- Stay away
	The furred creature stares at you for an uncomfortable amount of time. Should you have acted first? What will it try to do? While these thoughts swirl in your head a distant snap draws the attention of the creature as it swiftly turns it head towards that direction. You also pay attention to that direction. After a few more seconds of the silence the creature scurries away back into the tall grass. Allowing you to continue down the road.
- Scare it off
	Grabbing a nearby fallen stick you attempt to scare off the creature. You way the stick threateningly towards the creature while screaming at it. It gets a little surprised moving a little bit backwards. The creature stamps its hind legs clearly readying itself. While you keep trying to scare it off the creature charges you with its horns. You defend yourself with your arms but they get punctured in the process. You shake off your attacker as it runs off back into the tall grass. Maybe it wasn’t worth threatening it. You continue on. You lose 5 health
