The day has been long and the sky shows no change with the sun planted firmly in the sky. The forest has always been a mysterious place and you wonder if the day only drags on because of it. As you walk down the road you briefly hear something. 
The clanging of metal and something else. Sounds like you're not alone in this area. From behind a tree just up ahead a ragged figure appears. Definitely not human the figures armor is rusted and cloth is torn in other places revealing white bones underneath. It holds something that you just can’t see but you can tell it may hold some weight to it. While it doesn’t seem to have noticed you yet the item it holds could be of some value whether you decide to use or sell it. What should you do?
- Hide behind a nearby tree
	You quickly hide by a tree off to the side of the road before you're noticed by the entity. Once you've successfully hidden behind the tree your peer around it to observe the skeletal entity. It meanders about a bit before a small bunny hops out of a nearby bush. Noticing this the entity gives chase to the bunny brandishing the item that turned out to be a large sword. The entity chases the bunny off the unknown parts of the forest leaving the area. You're glad you didn't try and confront the skeletal being as it could have done great harm. The path is clear now so you continue on your way.
- Try and get closer to the entity
	You decide to try and get closer to the entity. Maybe if you play your cards right you could get something out of this. As you get closer you notice that the entity appears to be wearing armor and clothes that a town guard would wear. The entity notices you getting closer and it is revealed that the item you could just barely see is actually a large sword. 
	You immediately regret getting closer as the entity charges at you with sword in hand. You dodge the first blow but the second attack finds purchase straight into your side. You kick at the entity knocking it down as it seems to have trouble getting up due to the heavy armor it wears. This allows you to escape the entity. Once you are far enough away from the entity you dress your wound deeming it but a flesh wound but painful nonetheless. 
	do Globals.change_health(2)
	You lose some health.
