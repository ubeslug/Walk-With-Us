text = "Despite their name, Lovely Bushes are quite the hostile species of flora that can be found in forests. They are a carnivorous plant that lures in its prey with an alluring scent that spreads from the berries and flowers that grow on it.  

When its target gets close enough this creature will lash out with its roots to try and entangle the prey, locking down its movements. The Lovely Bush will then slowly drain its target's blood by impaling it;s roots into their bodies. Lovely Bushes can be identified by the unique feature of the berries and flowers that they grow. This unique feature is that the berries and flowers tend to give a strong sweet smelling aroma while also being multicolored. 

While the Lovely Bushes tend to prey on smaller creatures they can leave significant harm to larger creatures that come too close."
