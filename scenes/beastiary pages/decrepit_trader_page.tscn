This trader seems to show up at any place they wish, as they have been seen in various places both in settlements and in the wilderness. Some of their body is shrouded in an unknown shade but the parts that are visible seem to be skeletal or rotting. 

While their trades always seemed simple and innocent, we know better now. And from our lack of precautions we have lost one of our own. We urge you to scrutinize every exchange from traders because they are all shrewd in their own way."
