text = "After much analysis of this so-called “Agent”, I have come to the conclusion that he is a servant to something much larger than this town can comprehend. While I do not know who or what he works for, his mission here is to collect and feed on misery that he inflicts upon us. He markets this town to new people only to destroy their wealth and repeat the cycle with a new group of unlucky saps, keeping himself and his master fed. 

However, I have also discovered something that can take him down. While the Agent is a master of manipulation, that is his only strength, as any physical strength he has comes due to people’s perception of him. If you see him as a string and powerful being, he will swing like one. But if you see him for what he is, just a tool for some larger power, he won’t stand a chance against you. If you are reading this, please take him down before this cycle continues again."
