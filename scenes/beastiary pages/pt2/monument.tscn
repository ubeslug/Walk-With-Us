text = "The Monument Matriarch is a creature that has lived in these lands for ages. Her origins are unknown but it is known that she used to serve as a negotiator and protector for the town, mainly being a communicator for deals and bargains. This was due to her high level of intelligence, comprehension, and ability to turn unlucky people into stone. However, she has recently fallen into a depressive state of which we are not certain the origin of. 

She depends on smell and hearing to navigate as her eyesight is poor. If she senses you in her domain, she will likely become aggressive. If this is the case, use her poor eyesight against her. However, should she be in a calmer state, it is likely that she will be receptive to negotiations and deals."
